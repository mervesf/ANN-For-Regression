# ANN-For-Regression
In this project, I aimed to create an artificial neural network (ANN) for regression analysis on a dataset about Halloween candies. It involves data preprocessing, visualization with box plots and heatmaps, and finally training a neural network model to predict the "win percent" of different candies based on various features.
